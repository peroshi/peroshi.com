Work in the Alps is the newest incarnation of a family business started over 30 years ago, which finds jobs in the hospitality industry for UK students in the Swiss Alps.

The owners wanted a placeholder site which would give them an online presence while they built up the rest of their business. The design needed to reflect its Oxford roots, the seasonality of the industry, and the professionalism required by their corporate clients.

We designed and built the site over a short timeframe using Django, allowing them to expand into a full jobs site in the future.
