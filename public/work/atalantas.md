Founded in 1992, Atalanta's Society promotes women's sport at the University of Oxford, especially for those who have represented the university as Blues or Half-Blues.

The society was looking for a new website to replace their existing WordPress solution. They were also looking to simplify event management, including payments, and handle their membership and subscription dues.

To achieve this, we built them a new Django-powered website, and integrated Eventbrite to allow seamless publishing of events. The next phase will extend Django to handle membership information.
